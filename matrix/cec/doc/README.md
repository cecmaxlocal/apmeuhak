# Apmeuhak

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
![Raku Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/raku-6.d+-blue.svg)
![Made with FreeBASIC](https://img.shields.io/badge/Interface-FreeBASIC-green.svg)
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

A unique, polyglot music development toolkit powered by a Raku Butterfly core and a FreeBASIC user interface.

## ðŸŽµ About The Project

**Apmeuhak** is a creative environment for music development, composition, and file manipulation. It leverages the strength of two distinct languages:

*   **Raku (Butterfly):** The core logic, file parsing, music theory engine, and data manipulation are handled by Raku. Its powerful grammar engine (for parsing complex music formats), concurrency features, and expressive syntax make it ideal for the backend.
*   **FreeBASIC:** The user interface and real-time components are built with FreeBASIC, which compiles to fast, lightweight, native executables with minimal dependencies. This provides a snappy and responsive user experience.

This project aims to be a bridge between high-level musical concepts and low-level performance, providing a powerful set of tools for hobbyists and professionals alike.

## âœ¨ Key Features

*   **Polyglot Architecture:** Combines the best of Raku's high-level expressiveness and FreeBASIC's raw speed.
*   **Extensible Library:** A modular design centered around the `Lib/` directory allows for easy addition of new formats, effects, or instruments.
*   **Music-Focused Tools:** Built from the ground up to handle MIDI, music notation, synth definitions, and other music-related file formats.
*   **Customizable IDE Experience:** The `IDEHak/` directory is dedicated to scripts and configurations for enhancing your development workflow in various IDEs.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Designed to work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

*   **`Bin/`**: Contains the final compiled binaries ready for execution.
*   **`Lib/`**: The heart of the Raku backend. All Raku modules (`.rakumod`) reside here.
*   **`Doc/`**: Project documentation, user manuals, and API specifications.
*   **`Image/`**: Icons, logos, screenshots, and other graphical assets.
*   **`IDEHak/`**: A collection of settings, configurations, and "hacks" to improve the development experience in various IDEs (e.g., VSCode, Atom, Vim).
*   **`t/`**: Automated tests for the Raku modules. This is crucial for maintaining stability.
*   **`project/`**: Contains project source files, build scripts, and other development-related resources. The FreeBASIC source and build automation live here.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system:
*   **Raku** and its package manager **zef**: [https://raku.org/downloads](https://raku.org/downloads)
*   **FreeBASIC Compiler (fbc)**: [https://www.freebasic.net/get](https://www.freebasic.net/get)
*   **Git**: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation & Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/apmeuhak.git
    cd apmeuhak
    ```

2.  **Install Raku dependencies:**
    ```sh
    zef install --deps-only .
    ```

3.  **Compile the FreeBASIC interface:**
    Navigate to the project directory and run the build script.
    ```sh
    cd project/
    bash build.sh
    ```
    This will compile `main.bas` and place the executable `apmeuhak` into the `Bin/` directory.

## ðŸ’» Usage

Once built, you can run the application directly from the `Bin/` directory:

```sh
./Bin/apmeuhak
```

You can also pass files as arguments:
```sh
./Bin/apmeuhak my-composition.midi
```

For more details on command-line options and features, please consult the documentation in the `Doc/` folder.
